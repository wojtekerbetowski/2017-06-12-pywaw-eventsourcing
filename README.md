# Event Sourcing in Django

Presentation notes for PyWaw community talk on 2017-06-12.

## Tools used

* Deckset
* Sketch
                                                              
## Images

Deckset loads images via links. Therefore you need to serve them localy to have them picked up.
E.g. `python3 -m http.server`
